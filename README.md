# ReactJS Take Home Assignment

Develop a product page for a fictional e-commerce website. The product information will be fetched from an API endpoint.

You can use this design or any other that you want to use : <br />

**Requirements:**

- **Frontend (ReactJS):**
  - Create a React component for the product page.
  - Display the product details on the page, including name, description, price, image, and other relevant information using this [API endpoint](https://linode25.eqserver.net/mock_product_response.json)
  - Implement basic user interaction features like adding the product to a cart (simulated functionality, no backend integration required).
  - Consider using a state management solution (Redux, Context API) to manage product data and cart state (optional).
  - Style the product page using CSS or a styling library like Bootstrap or Material UI.

**Bonus points:**

- Implement a product image carousel to showcase multiple product images.
- Allow users to select different product variants (e.g., size, color) before adding to cart.
- Integrate with a payment gateway API (simulated functionality) for a complete checkout experience (advanced).
- Implement user reviews and ratings functionality (advanced).

**Evaluation Criteria:**

- Code quality, structure, and maintainability (use of React best practices).
- Effective use of components and state management for data handling.
- User interface design, responsiveness, and overall user experience.
- Ability to complete the challenge within a reasonable timeframe (consider complexity and experience level).

**Additional Notes:**

- You are welcome to use any additional libraries or packages that you find helpful for the project (e.g., Axios for API calls).
- While a fully functional e-commerce system is not required, demonstrating the core functionalities of a product page is sufficient.
